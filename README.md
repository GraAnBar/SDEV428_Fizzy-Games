**Group Project Proposal - “Liberandum”**

Game name at the bottom

**Group Name:** 
The name of the group will be “Fizzy Games”. It is simple but it is a fitting name for the idea. It is fizz from a soda that can seem refreshing and we hope to do that with the skills we have in making the game.

**Group Preferred Method of Communication:**
We have decided that the best way to communicate for this project is through Discord. We will be meeting together in discord calls and we will share each other’s process in both a discord call and the channels.

**GitHub Repository:**

**The Game We Would Like to Make:**
This will be a top-down angle 2D pixel art roguelike action game where the player explores room to room fighting enemy hordes to complete each room and earn power-ups after completing each room. After 10 rooms at max (we will just have the rooms made for the project) There will be a boss fight that tests your skills and the power-ups that you got from the previous room.

**Game Description:**
A brave knight has been quested to visit a deep, dark, dungeon to deliver a beautiful princess back to her kingdom. The princess has been taken away by an evil wizard from an unknown land who swept her away during the darkness of the night. It is said that the dungeon contains many rooms with unique obstacles as well as ancient spells and technology with untold power. The brave knight will have to use these ancient spells and technology to overcome the dangers of the dark dungeon to deliver the princess back to her kingdom.

**Game Name:**
“Liberandum” (“Rescue” in Latin)
